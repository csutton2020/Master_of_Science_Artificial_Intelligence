These correlations in the data between the features should help to produce a working model. Yes, when powerful features are selected from this dataset, a machine learning model can certainly be built and tested."

    "\n",
    "The first step in building a model is simply to look at the available data to see what features are available to be learned. In this first step I see there are twelve features and 27820 data rows.  Second, step is to check for any missing values, erronous data points, and what data types the structure has. I see that one feature, \"HDI for year\" is missing nearly 2/3 of its values. In my judgement, engineering 2/3 of the values for \"HDI for year\" does not seem useful when there are other features to machine learn on. In cases like this, I would opt to remove that entire feature and not use it in the model. I this case I will be removing 'HDI for year\" from the model, simply due to the amount of missing values. Additionally, after graphng each country with \"Year\" X \"suicides/100k pop\" X \"age\". I see that there are a list of countries who are simply reporting zero suicides for most years. I don't want to contiminate my dataset with data from countries who are not reporting accurate information. This is another judgement call on my part but it is intuitive to me that zero suicides are highly unlikly in a country's population. I will process the data and remove these countries that seem to be offending the dataset in this manner. An option would be to input statisitically meaningful values where I felt a country was constantly reporting zeros but in that case I again have the view that I don't want to contaminate the model on purpose with statistical noise unless I have to. For the third step, I would preprocess any categorial features into numerical ones. I have to take care to make sure to use ordinal features or nominal ones where appropriate. Forth, I would then build a correlation matrix to assess the correlations between the features. I want to build a model based on powerful features to reduce the amount of noise the model in contending with. As stated above, It seems the features having the best correlation with \"suicides/100k pop\" are \"age\", \"generation\"and \"sex\". I am modeling this as a classification problem. I have taken \"suicides/100k pop\" and binned it into two groups to build a dependent variable. One group is 17.73 per 100K and less and the other group is greater than 17.73 per 100K, where 17.73 represents the the top quartile of suicides per 100k. \n"
