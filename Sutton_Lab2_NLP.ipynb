    "#### As of Lab 2 this course is already getting quite interesting with classifing languages based on a trained LM. The key to to completing the Lab was understaning the LM data structure and being able to navigate and parse it to pull in the required probabilites for estimation. I completed the lab using split methods to sort data to my liking but one the last problem I moved over to regEx. I haven't ever had much experience with regEx but it's has come up on some coding entrace tests for the US government so I want to get a better intuition with it. "

Finally, repeat the experiment with higher-order n-grams. Try both a bigramand 4-gram model. How do your results change?
