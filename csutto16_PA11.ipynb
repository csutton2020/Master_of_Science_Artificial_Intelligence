    "## Reinforcement Learning with Value Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the same maps from Module 1 but the \"physics\" of the world have changed. In Module 1, the world was deterministic. When the agent moved \"south\", it went \"south\". When it moved \"east\", it went \"east\". Now, the agent only succeeds in going where it wants to go *sometimes*. There is a probability distribution over the possible states so that when the agent moves \"south\", there is a small probability that it will go \"east\", \"north\", or \"west\" instead and have to move from there.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a variety of ways to handle this problem. For example, if using A\\* search, if the agent finds itself off the solution, you can simply calculate a new solution from where the agent ended up. Although this sounds like a really bad idea, it has actually been shown to work really well in video games that use formal planning algorithms (which we will cover later). When these algorithms were first designed, this was unthinkable. Thank you, Moore's Law!\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach is to use Reinforcement Learning which covers problems where there is some kind of general uncertainty in the actions. We're going to model that uncertainty a bit unrealistically here but it'll show you how the algorithm works.\n",
    "\n",
    "As far as RL is concerned, there are a variety of options there: model-based and model-free, Value Iteration, Q-Learning and SARSA. You are going to use Value Iteration."

    "## The World Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "As before, we're going to simplify the problem by working in a grid world. The symbols that form the grid have a special meaning as they specify the type of the terrain and the cost to enter a grid cell with that type of terrain:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "token   terrain    cost \n",
    ".       plains     1\n",
    "*       forest     3\n",
    "^       hills      5\n",
    "~       swamp      7\n",
    "x       mountains  impassible\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you go from a plains node to a forest node it costs 3. When you go from a forest node to a plains node, it costs 1. You can think of the grid as a big graph. Each grid cell (terrain symbol) is a node and there are edges to the north, south, east and west (except at the edges).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are quite a few differences between A\\* Search and Reinforcement Learning but one of the most salient is that A\\* Search returns a plan of N steps that gets us from A to Z, for example, A->C->E->G.... Reinforcement Learning, on the other hand, returns  a *policy* that tells us the best thing to do in **every state.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the policy might say that the best thing to do in A is go to C. However, we might find ourselves in D instead. But the policy covers this possibility, it might say, D->E. Trying this action might land us in C and the policy will say, C->E, etc. At least with offline learning, everything will be learned in advance (in online learning, you can only learn by doing and so you may act according to a known but suboptimal policy).\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, if you were asked for a \"best case\" plan from (0, 0) to (n-1, n-1), you could (and will) be able to read it off the policy because there is a best action for every state. You will be asked to provide this in your assignment."

Use \"x\" for any mountain or other impassable square. Note that it doesn't need the `world` because the policy has a move for every state.
